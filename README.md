# Forms - Exercises 2.6 - 2.10

Written by Frederik Lundsbjerg, s205472

My explanation of my changes to the project, for which I have made exercises 2.6 - 2.10. 

As explained in the last line above the assignment in the link https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2/forms#exercises-2-6-2-10 
I have taken that starting point from the code in branch "part2-3", found here https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/part2-notes/tree/part2-3

Clarification regarding exercise 2.8: 
It is unclear whether the validation is supposed to include the number in regard to what triggers the alert message from exercise 2.7.
I have interpreted that the combination of name and phone number should trigger the alert.
